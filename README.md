# Python-Projects
All of my Python assignments from the tech academy

Including:

-Phonebook
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
-Check files
This project allows the user to choose tranfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
